Introduction
============

This library packages `Galleria Slideshow`_ for `fanstatic`_. It is aware
of different modes (normal, minified).

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`Galleria Slideshow`: http://galleria.io

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.galleria``) are published to some URL.
