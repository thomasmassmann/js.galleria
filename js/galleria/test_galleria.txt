How to use?
===========

You can import Galleria from ``js.galleria`` and ``need`` it
where you want these resources to be included on a page::

  >>> from js.galleria import galleria
  >>> galleria.need()

You can use the classic theme, which is free to use::

  >>> from js.galleria import classic
  >>> classic.need()
